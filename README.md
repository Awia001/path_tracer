# Rust Pathtracer, writen in rust

A very basic pathtracer based on "Raytracing in One Weekend" (https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) written in rust which renders using SDL2. "Realtime" in the sense that it just draws whatever it has every frame and doesn't care.

To run it, just run it, you'll get what you're given.

## Todo

- Shading
- Probably lots more...

## Possibles?

- Multithread the calculations so we can do multiple lines/sections at once
- AABB and BVH structures so we can go fast?
